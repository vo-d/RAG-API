1. What is a Builders League Hackathon?
Our hackathons are unique, collaborative events where participants work together as one large team on a shared challenge. Unlike traditional hackathons, we emphasize teamwork, rest, and creativity, with features like Code Freeze sessions to promote balance and productivity.
2. Who can participate in Builders League events?
If you have coding skills, you can join as a Builder to directly contribute to the challenge. If you don’t have coding experience, you can still participate as a GOAT volunteer to help with non-technical tasks like event coordination.
3. What roles exist in Builders League?
Builders: The core participants who solve problems, create projects, and tackle real-world challenges.
